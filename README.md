# Train CIFAR10 with PyTorch

I'm playing with [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) on the CIFAR10 dataset.

Pros:
- Built-in data loading and augmentation, very nice!
- Training is fast, maybe even a little bit faster.
- Very memory efficient!

Cons:
- No progress bar, sad :(
- No built-in log.

Accuracy:
- VGG16: 92.64%
- ResNet18: 93.02%
- ResNet50: 93.62%
- ResNet101: 93.75%
- DenseNet121: 95.04%
