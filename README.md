# Train cifar10 with PyTorch

I'm trying to achieve a similar accuracy as [xtorch](https://github.com/kuangliu/xtorch) on the cifar10 dataset with [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/).

Pros:
- Built-in data loading and augmentation, very nice!
- Training is fast, maybe even a little bit faster.
- Very memory efficient!

Cons:
- No progress bar, sad :(
- No built-in log.
